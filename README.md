**QA Analyst | Manual Testing & Test Automation Foundations | SQL & Python**

I'm a recent Management Information Systems graduate building a career in software quality assurance. I leverage my technical foundation to not just find bugs, but to understand their root cause in business logic and system architecture. I'm actively seeking a remote QA role where I can apply my skills in test case design, API testing, and defect tracking to help teams ship reliable products.
